Replit Instruction — Fix Event Card “Details” Button to Show Content
Problem:
When I click on the “Details” button on any event card (e.g., Robo War, Robo Soccer, etc.) on the website, nothing happens—the event modal does not open or show any details.

What I Want:
When the “Details” button is clicked on each event card, a styled modal (with neon outlines as previously requested) should open and display the correct event’s details. Each modal should contain the following event-specific content:

Event Details Content to Display in Each Modal

Technical Instructions for Developer
Check Event Card Markup:
Ensure each event card has a uniquely identifiable “Details” button (via data-event attribute or unique IDs).

Implement Modal Logic:

When a “Details” button is clicked, open a modal popup.

The modal should display the specific details for that event only (based on which button was clicked).

Only one modal should be open at a time; clicking outside or on a close button should dismiss the modal.

Modal Content Mapping:

Use a mapping (object or array) to associate each event (Robo War, Robo Soccer, etc.) with its corresponding event details as provided above.

When a button is clicked, read its identifier and populate the modal with the matching content.

Styling:

The modal should have a neon-styled border/outline following the existing site theme.

Ensure modal is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile.

Testing:

Click each Details button and confirm the corresponding event’s details are shown.

Close the modal and confirm it clears as expected.

Test on desktop and mobile breakpoints.

Summary:
Ensure clicking the “Details” button on any event card opens a modal popup with the matching event description from above. Style the modal as previously instructed, and ensure it’s bug-free on all devices.

Robofest 2025 Website Enhancement – Committee Page & Related Fixes
1. Add a “Committee” Page in Navigation
Navbar:
Insert a new “Committee” page after “About” and before “Contact” (navigation order must match).

Make sure the page is accessible from the navbar on all devices.

2. Structure & Sections on Committee Page
a. Patrons
First section: "Patrons"

Use the first 4 patron images provided (see images 1–4, already uploaded).

Below each image, display the patron’s name and designation/title.

Layout:

On desktop: arrange cards/images in a clean horizontal row.

On mobile/tablet: stack vertically OR enable a horizontal scroll/slider (user-friendly for wide lists).

Use neat card or shadow styling to match Robofest's look and feel (modest neon outline if on-theme).

b. Advisory Committee
Next section: "Advisory Committee"

For now, add 8-10 placeholder cards; user will provide images, names, designations next.

Each card: placeholder image, "To be updated", and placeholder for designation.

Use a horizontal scroller/slider for overflow—smooth on both desktop & mobile.

c. Core Members
Section: "Core Members"

Same as Advisory: 8-10 placeholder cards (ready for user’s upcoming images).

Each card: placeholder image and text ("To be updated", designation placeholder).

Use horizontal scroller/slider as above.

d. Developers
Last section: "Developers"

Add three cards: image, name, then designation (“Developer”) under each.

Use placeholders for now if images not supplied.

Layout should match rest (horizontal scroll if space needed).

Accessibility:

Every image should use ALT text in the format: “Full Name – Role/Committee”.

Design/Implementation:

Use reusable card components (if in React).

All scrollers must be smooth and support both mouse/touch (swipe on mobile).

If images/names not yet supplied, use “To be updated” clearly.

3. Roborarz Page Fixes
Replace “Video Unavailable”:

Swap all “Video unavailable” or failed video areas with a relevant event static image or placeholder thumbnail.

Remove Extra Social/Follow Us:

Completely delete any “Follow Us @robofest…” or extra social media sections.

Remove extra glow effects on Roborarz headings.

Remove “Robot Assembly Showcase” section:

Delete this section in its entirety.

4. Responsiveness & Layout Bug Fixes
Register Now Page:

Remove all right-side gaps/empty space and fully eliminate horizontal scroll at every screen width.

Ensure page content fits viewport (both desktop and mobile)—test thoroughly, especially on the Register Now screen.

Site-wide:

Review Committee, About, Register Now, and all modal popups for responsive issues.

All cards (event/sponsor/committee), buttons, modals, and horizontal scrollers must scale and fit smoothly on all screens (mobile, tablet, desktop). No overflow, clipped text, or broken layouts.

5. General
Use descriptive alt text for each image (as above).

All styles and components should follow the current Robofest site theme.

Committee scrollers/components must not break if you add/remove members—future updates should be simple ("add to list" pattern).

Leave comments in code to guide future editors on how to add/update committee members or images.

Preview every change on both desktop and mobile before marking complete.

Developer Notes
You will receive more images and member details for Advisory and Core sections soon; current cards must be ready for these updates.

If in React, use mapped arrays and modular card components for all committee member types.

Make sure the Committee page is listed correctly in the navbar and is accessible from everywhere.

If you have any confusion about image layout or card styling, follow the style used for event cards throughout the site.

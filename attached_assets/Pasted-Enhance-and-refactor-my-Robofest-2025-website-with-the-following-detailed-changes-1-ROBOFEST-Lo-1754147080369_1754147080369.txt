Enhance and refactor my Robofest 2025 website with the following detailed changes:

1. ROBOFEST Logo Update:
Replace the current "R" icon in the navbar and homepage header with the new image that I will upload.

Ensure the logo updates correctly everywhere it appears, and alt text reflects "ROBOFEST Logo".

2. Navbar Reordering and Refactor:
Rearrange navbar so the "Roboroarz" menu item appears directly after "Events" and before "About".

Ensure smooth scroll navigation/anchor linking continues to function seamlessly for all menu entries.

3. Event Cards Enhancement:
On each event card (e.g., Robo War, Robo Soccer, etc.), add a "Details" button.

Clicking the "Details" button should open a modal popup or expandable section showing the full event details (details are provided below for all events — embed them accordingly).

Style each modal/expansion with neon outlines that match the theme and look good in both light and dark modes.

Remove the “Learn More” button everywhere in favor of the new "Details" popups.

Event details content is included below for all events.

Event Details Content:
Robowar: [Insert the full Robowar details content provided above into the modal]
Robo Soccer: [Insert full Robo Soccer details]
Robo Sumo: [Insert full Robo Sumo details]
Drone Race: [Insert full Drone Race details]
Obstacle Race: [Insert full Obstacle Race details]
Line Follower: [Insert full Line Follower details]

4. Remove Obsolete Sections:
Delete the ENTIRE "Robotic Assembly" and "Showcase" (video placeholders) sections.

Replace those sections with relevant image thumbnails instead.

5. About Section Redesign:
Remove the "Our Mission, Vision, Values" content and heading completely.

Add the SRM University and CTech Department logos (user will provide these) near the top of the new About section.

In the Sponsor section, include cards labeled Platinum Sponsor, Gold Sponsor, and Silver Sponsor—each card should be able to show a sponsor logo.

The sponsor cards should display horizontally on desktop and stack on mobile.

6. Visual and UI Upgrades:
Integrate interactive 3D robotic animations on the homepage and between sections using animated SVGs, Three.js, or other methods. You can use existing assets or find suitable ones as needed.

Fix the robotic animation so it is fully visible and works on both desktop and mobile views—currently, it only works on desktop.

Reduce or remove excessive glow effects from all major headings (like “ROBOFEST 2025” and event names) for a cleaner look.

7. Footer & Contact Updates:
Move the Instagram handle (@robofest.srm) to the footer—styled consistently with other footer items.

Remove the old Instagram block from the body/middle of the page.

8. Mobile Responsiveness & Bug Fixes:
On the Register Now page, fix the layout to eliminate any extra horizontal scroll or empty space on the right side.

Ensure all modals, sponsor cards, event cards, buttons, and animations SCALE PROPERLY across mobile and tablet views (test all breakpoints and fix layouts/CSS as needed).

Keep existing color scheme, style, and core design UNLESS told otherwise. Write all code and configuration in a way that will work directly in my current Replit project.

Developer Notes:
You will receive new image/logo assets from the project owner.

Full event details are embedded above; if you need them again, ask the owner to upload.

Prioritize accessibility, performance, and clean code practices!

Once done, preview the site on desktop and common mobile screen sizes to confirm all changes apply and layouts are correct.
